# Assignment #9 - Giphy API

## About this Repo:
This neat little site is an example of querying APIs, Giphy in this case,
and handling the received JSON data. The goal of this site was to query Giphy and
display some GIF images.

## GitHub Pages:
This site can be interacted with by visiting its [GitHub Pages URL](https://allhailthetail.github.io/giphy-api/)

# ToDo:
- [x] Copy the starter repository <br>
- [x] Create an API key with Giphy and finding the endpoint URLs <br>
- [x] Updating the repository's code to fetch the GIFs (URLs) and display them (DOM interaction) <br>
- [ ] Extra - Implement full-fledged search functionality <br>
- [ ] Personal wants - clear the page each time button is pressed* <br>

> * Alternatively, it could display the next 4 images below the first... ðŸ¤”
